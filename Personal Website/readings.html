      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>It's always nice to see the growth of things especially the online realm since it has evolved so quickly and in such a short time. Prior to reading Rachel Greene's article, Web Work: A History of Internet Art, I would have never considered or dived into the notion of cyber art being a form of legitimate works. The virtual world has always been a place to explore, exchange, and communicate without abiding by formal constructs. Therefore, allowing a sense of liberty like typing into the void on your 15-year-old self's Tumblr blog, about how Jessica was awfully rude today, or tweeting ordinary happenings, sets the tone of the internet’s fluidity. This nonchalant and sometimes humorous approach towards the internet simultaneously contrasts and relates to the attitude of net.artists and net.art. The contrast lies within my intent vs. the net.artists'.</p>

      <p> In 1995, a software-glitched e-mail delivered the earliest net.art and birthed an internet- based movement. One where radical intellects and artists exhibited on websites like Nettime, Syndicate, and Rhizome. Websites whose ethos are political, theoretical, or centered on new- media. At the time, the internet was still "unoccupied" and vast; in the sense that, it's not as crowded and saturated as it is today. We could walk miles on end if we converted the amount of data footprint we've accumulated into real-life steps. Nettime being a popular platform for net.artists to express themselves versus Tumblr being my oasis of expression are like both sides of the same coin. This is where I find things interesting. Net.artists found security and liberty in the exclusivity of the virtual world. In fact, mainstream media taking over was so disfavored that a project called "Name.Space" by New York-based artist, Paul Garrin, was conceptualized. "The logic of Name.Space was that if there were a more expansive set of names for websites, it would be more difficult for corporations or individuals to monopolize Web addresses." (p.4). The internet has evolved since then and has become a part of our society’s daily.  Due to the internet’s crowdedness, I (like others I presume) have found comfort in the insignificance of my cyber input amongst the myriad of information on the internet.
      </p>

      <p> One of the works I’ve submitted in my admission’s portfolio is a glitch-art but I never thought it would be considered anything close to the fine arts, just a way to show my skills and competence. As a form of escape, I spent a good portion of my upbringing on the internet, and there’s still so much I don’t know of and have yet to learn... net.artists used the internet’s flexibility and rapidity to their own advantage, perhaps I will eventually use this virtual platform for greater purpose and noble expression.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>

      <p> The concept of computers designed for personal use—namely, access to information and global communication—brewed in the minds of like-minded intellects such as Bush, Licklider and Engelbart throughout the course of the internet’s origins. "The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly”, Licklider explains, “and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today." (Ch. 4, para. 12). I immediately compared this excerpt in “From Counterculture to Cyberculture” (the overall theme, even) to Daniel Joseph’s Vice article, “The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up”, partly discussing the complex relationship between net neutrality and privacy. How many of us, in today’s cyber generation, are apprehensive with personal data being distributed without agency? The contrast in today’s virtual concerns and hopes of the computation’s forefathers creates a sort of disconnect that begs new questions and possibly a rising counterculture. </p>

      <p> Learning and then unlearning to readapt is a part of the human experience and it also applies to the development of the internet or, at least, how we internet. Yes, the internet has largely contributed to the definition of connection yet how much connection is too much? It is important to consider context in this regard. What are today’s terms of confidentiality when we cannot even trust everyday platforms, such as Facebook connecting political ads (supporting Trump’s presidential campaign) to its users. To avoid data abuse, other nations established technological sovereignty by monitoring and filtering its citizen’s social media consumption. This too may be considered connected but it’s abstract, controlling and ultimately false.  </p>

      <p> Globally, we have come far since the expansion of online networking and technology, but also, I believe there is room for progress in the methods of our virtual connectedness. I have hopes that a new internet can evolve from what it is now—without growing furthermore insidious.  </p>

      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p> Issued in July 1945—As We May Think— is an essay written by American engineer Dr. Vannevar Bush. The article suggests a sense of hope as well as apprehension towards scientific development at the brink of World War II. Without this unifying purpose propelled by competitive warfare, scientific progression now expands beyond a singular goal. Equally, Bush encourages and guides those who dedicated their skills in the optimization of military technology to envision knowledge accessible to civilians. In this regard, Bush considers a concept, the “memex”, in which individuals obtain access to such information, as well as store personal resources. “It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory” (Bush 6) which is essentially like our current technologies — laptops, smartphones, and so on. </p>

      <p> I can understand why Bush’s article was significant for its time. Given the end of World War II, it is clear that Bush is concerned with where scientific motives will venture without military authority present.  He has witnessed how technology can contribute to destruction and hopes mankind uses such strength towards good. In today’s world, I believe many of us share the same sentiments. For instance, evidences of systemic racism in our society, often trivialized and falsely covered by the media in the past, are quickly accessible to us on various platforms such as Twitter. Twitter being a hub of information and thoughts by *real* everyday people. This is important because it reflects a realistic assessment of our society. On the other hand, technology is still being weaponized to this day. Or that, on a much lower scale, access to a myriad of information can be paralyzing and overwhelming— where would you begin with so much available? This goes to say that power and knowledge is neither good nor bad. We can only hope as much as Vannevar Bush. </p>
