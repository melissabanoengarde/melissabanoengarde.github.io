<h2>Readings and reflections</h2>
<h3>As We May Think</h3>

<p>
Issued in July 1945‚ÄîAs We May Think‚Äî is an essay written by American engineer Dr. Vannevar Bush. The article suggests a sense of hope as well as apprehension towards scientific development at the brink of World War II. Without this unifying purpose propelled by competitive warfare, scientific progression now expands beyond a singular goal. Equally, Bush encourages and guides those who dedicated their skills in the optimization of military technology to envision knowledge accessible to civilians. In this regard, Bush considers a concept, the ‚Äúmemex‚Äù, in which individuals obtain access to such information, as well as store personal resources. ‚ÄúIt is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory‚Äù (Bush 6) which is essentially like our current technologies ‚Äî laptops, smartphones, and so on.</p>
<p>I can understand why Bush‚Äôs article was significant for its time. Given the end of World War II, it is clear that Bush is concerned with where scientific motives will venture without military authority present. He has witnessed how technology can contribute to destruction and hopes mankind uses such strength towards good. In today‚Äôs world, I believe many of us share the same sentiments. For instance, evidences of systemic racism in our society, often trivialized and falsely covered by the media in the past, are quickly accessible to us on various platforms such as Twitter. Twitter being a hub of information and thoughts by *real* everyday people. This is important because it reflects a realistic assessment of our society. On the other hand, technology is still being weaponized to this day. Or that, on a much lower scale, access to a myriad of information can be paralyzing and overwhelming‚Äî where would you begin with so much available? This goes to say that power and knowledge is neither good nor bad. We can only hope as much as Vannevar Bush.</p>
