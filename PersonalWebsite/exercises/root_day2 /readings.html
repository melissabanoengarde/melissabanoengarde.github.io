  <h3>Week 2:</h3>

  <p>The concept of computers designed for personal use—namely, access to information and global communication—brewed in the minds of like-minded intellects such as Bush, Licklider and Engelbart throughout the course of the internet’s origins. "The
    hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly”, Licklider explains, “and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not
    approached by the information-handling machines we know today." (Ch. 4, para. 12). I immediately compared this excerpt in “From Counterculture to Cyberculture” (the overall theme, even) to Daniel Joseph’s Vice article, “The Time Canada Wanted Its
    Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up”, partly discussing the complex relationship between net neutrality and privacy. How many of us, in today’s cyber generation, are apprehensive with personal data being distributed without
    agency? The contrast in today’s virtual concerns and hopes of the computation’s forefathers creates a sort of disconnect that begs new questions and possibly a rising counterculture. </p>

  <p>Learning and then unlearning to readapt is a part of the human experience and it also applies to the development of the internet or, at least, how we internet. Yes, the internet has largely contributed to the definition of connection yet how
    much connection is too much? It is important to consider context in this regard. What are today’s terms of confidentiality when we cannot even trust everyday platforms, such as Facebook connecting political ads (supporting Trump’s presidential
    campaign) to its users. To avoid data abuse, other nations established technological sovereignty by monitoring and filtering its citizen’s social media consumption. This too may be considered connected but it’s abstract, controlling and
    ultimately false. </p>

  <p>Globally, we have come far since the expansion of online networking and technology, but also, I believe there is room for progress in the methods of our virtual connectedness. I have hopes that a new internet can evolve from what it is
    now—without growing furthermore insidious.

<h3>Week 1: </h3>

<p>
Issued in July 1945—As We May Think— is an essay written by American engineer Dr. Vannevar Bush. The article suggests a sense of hope as well as apprehension towards scientific development at the brink of World War II. Without this unifying purpose propelled by competitive warfare, scientific progression now expands beyond a singular goal. Equally, Bush encourages and guides those who dedicated their skills in the optimization of military technology to envision knowledge accessible to civilians. In this regard, Bush considers a concept, the “memex”, in which individuals obtain access to such information, as well as store personal resources. “It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory” (Bush 6) which is essentially like our current technologies — laptops, smartphones, and so on.</p>
<p>I can understand why Bush’s article was significant for its time. Given the end of World War II, it is clear that Bush is concerned with where scientific motives will venture without military authority present. He has witnessed how technology can contribute to destruction and hopes mankind uses such strength towards good. In today’s world, I believe many of us share the same sentiments. For instance, evidences of systemic racism in our society, often trivialized and falsely covered by the media in the past, are quickly accessible to us on various platforms such as Twitter. Twitter being a hub of information and thoughts by *real* everyday people. This is important because it reflects a realistic assessment of our society. On the other hand, technology is still being weaponized to this day. Or that, on a much lower scale, access to a myriad of information can be paralyzing and overwhelming— where would you begin with so much available? This goes to say that power and knowledge is neither good nor bad. We can only hope as much as Vannevar Bush.</p>
