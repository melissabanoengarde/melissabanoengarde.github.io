      The concept of computers designed for personal use—namely, access to information and global communication—brewed in the minds of like-minded intellects such as Bush, Licklider and Engelbart throughout the course of the internet’s origins. "The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly”, Licklider explains, “and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today." (Ch. 4, para. 12).

      I immediately compared this excerpt in “From Counterculture to Cyberculture” (the overall theme, even) to Daniel Joseph’s Vice article, “The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up”, partly discussing the complex relationship between net neutrality and privacy. How many of us, in today’s cyber generation, are apprehensive with personal data being distributed without agency? The contrast in today’s virtual concerns and hopes of the computation’s forefathers creates a sort of disconnect that begs new questions and possibly a rising counterculture.

      Learning and then unlearning to readapt is a part of the human experience and it also applies to the development of the internet or, at least, how we internet. Yes, the internet has largely contributed to the definition of connection yet how much connection is too much? It is important to consider context in this regard. What are today’s terms of confidentiality when we cannot even trust everyday platforms, such as Facebook connecting political ads (supporting Trump’s presidential campaign) to its users.

      To avoid data abuse, other nations established technological sovereignty by monitoring and filtering its citizen’s social media consumption. This too may be considered connected but it’s abstract, controlling and ultimately false.

     Globally, we have come far since the expansion of online networking and technology, but also, I believe there is room for progress in the methods of our virtual connectedness. I have hopes that a new internet can evolve from what it is now—without growing furthermore insidious.
