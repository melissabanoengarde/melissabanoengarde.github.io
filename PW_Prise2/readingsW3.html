      <br>
      It's always nice to see the growth of things especially the online realm since it has evolved so quickly and in such a short time. Prior to reading Rachel Greene's article, Web Work: A History of Internet Art, I would have never considered or dived into the notion of cyber art being a form of legitimate works. The virtual world has always been a place to explore, exchange, and communicate without abiding by formal constructs. Therefore, allowing a sense of liberty like typing into the void on your 15-year-old self's Tumblr blog, about how Jessica was awfully rude today, or tweeting ordinary happenings, sets the tone of the internet’s fluidity.

      This nonchalant and sometimes humorous approach towards the internet simultaneously contrasts and relates to the attitude of net.artists and net.art. The contrast lies within my intent vs. the net.artists'.

      In 1995, a software-glitched e-mail delivered the earliest net.art and birthed an internet- based movement. One where radical intellects and artists exhibited on websites like Nettime, Syndicate, and Rhizome. Websites whose ethos are political, theoretical, or centered on new- media. At the time, the internet was still "unoccupied" and vast; in the sense that, it's not as crowded and saturated as it is today. We could walk miles on end if we converted the amount of data footprint we've accumulated into real-life steps.

       Nettime being a popular platform for net.artists to express themselves versus Tumblr being my oasis of expression are like both sides of the same coin. This is where I find things interesting. Net.artists found security and liberty in the exclusivity of the virtual world. In fact, mainstream media taking over was so disfavored that a project called "Name.Space" by New York-based artist, Paul Garrin, was conceptualized. "The logic of Name.Space was that if there were a more expansive set of names for websites, it would be more difficult for corporations or individuals to monopolize Web addresses." (p.4). The internet has evolved since then and has become a part of our society’s daily.  Due to the internet’s crowdedness, I (like others I presume) have found comfort in the insignificance of my cyber input amongst the myriad of information on the internet.

      One of the works I’ve submitted in my admission’s portfolio is a glitch-art but I never thought it would be considered anything close to the fine arts, just a way to show my skills and competence. As a form of escape, I spent a good portion of my upbringing on the internet, and there’s still so much I don’t know of and have yet to learn... net.artists used the internet’s flexibility and rapidity to their own advantage, perhaps I will eventually use this virtual platform for greater purpose and noble expression.
